This infographic shows data from the Wall Street Journal article "This Idaho Town Could Become the Next Jackson Hole—but Don’t Tell Locals That" by Nancy Keates. This article highlights a small town called Driggs in Eastern Idaho, close to the Wyoming border,that it shoing potential to become the next popular and posh ski resort town. The article shows the increasing median prices of homes as well as the increasing population. Developers are creating luxury communities is the area, such as the Tributary community.The driving force behind this change is the growing Grand Targhee Ski Resort which is planning to expand by 30%. The people of Driggs are split as to how they feel about the town's changes. Some like how they will be able to grow their businesses, but others are afraid that Driggs will lose it's charm and become a city with overpriced food, snooty visits, and lots of traffic.
