# Infographic of Home Prices in a Small Town in Idaho
This infographic shows data from the Wall Street Journal article "This Idaho Town Could Become the Next Jackson Hole—but Don’t Tell Locals That" by Nancy Keates. This article highlights a small town called Driggs in Eastern Idaho, close to the Wyoming border,that it shoing potential to become the next popular and posh ski resort town. The article shows the increasing median prices of homes as well as the increasing population. Developers are creating luxury communities is the area, such as the Tributary community.The driving force behind this change is the growing Grand Targhee Ski Resort which is planning to expand by 30%. The people of Driggs are split as to how they feel about the town's changes. Some like how they will be able to grow their businesses, but others are afraid that Driggs will lose it's charm and become a city with overpriced food, snooty visits, and lots of traffic.

# Scatter Plot For the Fastest Growing Countries 
This scatter plot shows the relationship between Employment Growth and GDP Per Capita in the 10 fasts growing metropolitan areas in the world according to Bookings. The X-Axis represents the employment growth percentage and the Y-Axis represents the GDP Per Capita growth percentage. The cities included in this chart include: Fuzhou, China; Ankara, Turkey; Xiamen, China; Hangzhou, China; Kunming, China; Dubai, UAE; Bursa, Turkey; Istanbul, Turkey; Izmir, Turkey; annd Macau. Each city has a unique indusrty that makes it so prosperous, and a common theme among these metropolitian areas is that they are the home of an industry within their country. Whether the city is the leader of manufacturing, local government or culture, all cities on this list are stretegically located and are good at what they do. Every single city on this list besides Dubai and Macau is in China and Turkey. This makes me wonder what the world will look like in 20 years if the fastest growing cities are saturated into two countries.
